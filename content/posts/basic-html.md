## Headings

Let's start with all possible headings. The HTML `<h1>`—`<h6>` elements represent six levels of section headings. `<h1>` is the highest section level and `<h6>` is the lowest.

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

## Paragraph

According to the [HTML5 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#elements) by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/), **HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text**. Each element is denoted in the source by a [start tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-start-tags), such as `<body>`, and an [end tag](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#syntax-end-tags), such as `</body>`. (*Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be omitted and are implied by other tags.*)

Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. For example, hyperlink are formed using the `a` element and its `href` attribute.

## Links

This is a [internal link](/posts/emoji-support) to another page. [This one](https://www.gohugo.io) points to a external page nad will be open in a new tag.

> Quoted text.
> This line is part of the same quote.
> Also you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Blockquote with a citation.

## Tables

Tables aren't part of the core Markdown spec, but Hugo supports them.

| ID  | Make      | Model   | Year |
| --- | --------- | ------- | ---- |
| 1   | Honda     | Accord  | 2009 |
| 2   | Toyota    | Camry   | 2012 |
| 3   | Hyundai   | Elantra | 2010 |

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables      | Are           | Cool         |
|:----------- |:-------------:| ------------:|
| align: left | align: center | align: right |
| align: left | align: center | align: right |
| align: left | align: center | align: right |

You can also use inline Markdown.

| Inline     | Markdown  | In                | Table      |
| ---------- | --------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| *italics*  | **bold**  | ~~strikethrough~~ | `code`     |
