    <h2>Backend Developer | Data Scientist | Data Engineer </h2>    
    <div id="shortResume">
        <p>I'm a passionate Data Scientist with a genuine love for algorithms, data visualization, and machine learning. A graduate in Information Systems from UFPE, I bring a unique mix of academic rigor and hands-on experience, constantly pushing the boundaries of what data can achieve.</p>
        <p>Beyond my professional focus, I have a deep fascination for horror—whether it's reading about horror games, watching horror movies, or exploring eerie, immersive stories. I also enjoy designing and playing games, from video games to complex board games, finding both their strategic and narrative layers incredibly engaging.
